Concerned about what open-source license to choose? We recommend visiting [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) which will walk you through what you are interested in accomplishing with your license.  This [blog post](http://www.crunchyfriday.com/anatomy-of-open-source-license-no-legal-terms-used/) also has some good questions to ask yourself.

Once you have selected a license, please make sure and include a `LICENSE.txt` file.  Github makes this easy, [explained in this post](https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license).
