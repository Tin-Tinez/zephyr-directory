This directory strives to list open-source code that is well-documented and broadly-useful to the community. As such, we ask that projects to be considered for listing have:

 - an open-source license  
 - a comprehensive README.md file that adheres to [these principles](https://gist.github.com/e-lo/a3c5bb41c993340a6e443741f1c2bfd4)  
 - be either broadly useful or serve as a well-documented example from which to learn
 
If you think your project qualifies or you'd like to learn more, please send us a note.
