## Separate repositories for separate things
Create separate git repositories for projects that are independently-developed or only loosely coupled with each other.  

## Same repository for same things
Have a significantly new version of your model or project? Please use 

## Many similar projects can be grouped under their own "organization"
Since tags or folders within [organizations](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations) is an [outstanding feature request](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/136) on GitHub, code managers should consider moving projects with multiple repositories ot their own ["organization"](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations).  This creates a dedicated domain where people can find these projects rather than having to sift through many irrelevant ones. 

This is also a good practice for organizations with more than a dozen or so projects.

There are many good discussions of what should be in separate repositories versus the same on [Stack Exchange](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/161293/choosing-between-single-or-multiple-projects-in-a-git-repository) and other mediums



## Transparency
Please make sure it is obvious who is contributing to the project and who they are affiliated with.  To that end:

 - Ensure team-members populate their name, email, and headshot.
 - Make team membership public
